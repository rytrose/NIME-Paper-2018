	abstract = {Group creativity is a fundamental form of human activity. In this paper we explore what constitutes mutually engaging interaction between people \_ interaction in which creative sparks fly and we lose ourselves in the joint action. In this paper we present the results of an experiment to compare the effect representation of identity in a user interface, and task instruction, has on mutual engagement between remote participants. Surprisingly the results indicate that providing no cues to identity increased mutual engagement between participants. We also discuss the appropriateness of quantitative, qualitative, and self-report data for identifying points of mutual engagement.},

	url = {http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2017/nime2017_paper0005.pdf},
	abstract = {The Feedback Cello is a new electroacoustic actuated instrument in which feedback can be induced independently on each string. Built from retro-fitted acoustic cellos, the signals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string are passed to a speaker built into the back of the instrument and to transducers clamped in varying places across the instrument body. Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations. Future developments and planned investigations are outlined.},

This setup poses a set of challenges in performing a music instrumentwhich changes over time and we suggest design guidelines such as making asmooth transition, varying adoption of change, and sharing information betweenthe pair of two performers. A proof-of-concept instrument is implemented on amobile device using UrMus, applying the suggested guidelines. We wish that thismodel would expand the scope of live coding to the distributed interactivesystem, drawing existing performance ideas of NIMEs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents concepts, models, and empirical findings relating to liveness and flow in the user experience of systems mediated by notation. Results from an extensive two-year field study of over 1,000 sequencer and tracker users, combining interaction logging, user surveys, and a video study, are used to illustrate the properties of notations and interfaces that facilitate greater immersion in musical activities and domains, borrowing concepts from programming to illustrate the role of visual and musical feedback, from the notation and domain respectively. The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically-rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software. Users are shown to maintain liveness through a rapid, iterative edit-audition cycle that integrates audio and visual feedback.},
